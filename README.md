This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when iterating over a `std::vector`. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an element beyond the vector's valid index range.  The corrected code is provided in `bugSolution.cpp`, highlighting the importance of using `i < vec.size()` for correct iteration.  This example helps illustrate the importance of careful index management when working with vectors and other dynamic arrays in C++.
